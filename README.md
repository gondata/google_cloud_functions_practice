# Google Cloud Functions Course
## Starting a project
To start a new project in Google Cloud, we can go to the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) or
create it from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
## Creating a virtual environment
First we have to install `python3-venv` with the following command:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Then, we execute the following command:
```
py -m venv venv
```
To activate the virtual environment we do:
```
venv/Scripts/activate
```
In order to add new packages to our new virtual environment we create a file calle `requirements.txt` and execute the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
